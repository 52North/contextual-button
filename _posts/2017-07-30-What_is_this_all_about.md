#What is this all about?

This blog accompanies me while I work on my entry into the [52°North Student Innovation Challenge 2017](http://52north.org/about/other-activities/student-innovation-prize/current-call). This years challenge focuses on connecting the Internet of Things with Sensor Web technology.

My idea here is inspired by the Amazon Dash Button a small Internet enabled deive that allows customers to order refills for consumable goods (e.g. razor blades, washing powder, etc.). Basically it is a small button that when pressed places your order on Amazon without needing further interaction from your side. The cool part is that button can be placed in the direct physical context relevant to it. So for example when you notice something is missing you can order it without having to leave your current pyhsical context to go online and order it on the Amazon website.

In this project I want to create a similar button that instead of ordering things online allows me to measure peoples interaction in specific contexts. The idea here is to provide a tool for small surveys. The button itself is then registered as a sensor in a Sensor Observation Service (SOS) providing a interface to collect and access the data.

As an example use case I thought of deploying a number of buttons all over the city of Münster to meassure perceived security at different location. Accompanying the button would be a poster asking people passing to press the button if they currently feel insecure. This way later it would be possible to identify areas and times where people feel insecure and then to address the reasons for this.
